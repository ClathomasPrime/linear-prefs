= Majority voting on restricted domains in
http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/20114/1/Majority_voting_on_restricted_domains_(LSERO).pdf

The wealth of domain-restriction conditions for avoiding majority cycles was
supplemented by another family of conditions based not on ëleftí-ërightíorders
of the alternatives, but on ëleftí-ërightí orders of the individuals.  Important
conditions in this family are Grandmontís intermediateness [17] and Rothsteinís
order restriction ([36], [37]) with its special case of single-crossingness
(e.g., Roberts [34], Saporiti and TohmÈ [38], Saporiti [39]). To illustrate, a proÖle
of individual preferences is order-restricted if the individuals ñrather than the
alternatives ñcan be ordered from ëleftíto ërightísuch that, for each pair of
alternatives x and y , the individuals preferring x to y are either all to the left,
or all the right, of those preferring y to x
